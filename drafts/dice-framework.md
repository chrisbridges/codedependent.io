# 	DICE - How to Answer Any Interview Question
	Do you ever find yourself unsure of how to answer a question in an interview? Even if you know the answer, it can be difficult to know what exactly to say, and how much you should say about it. Let’s break down a formula that will show you exactly how to answer these types of questions in an interview. We call it DICE. For our example today, let’s imagine that someone has asked us to explain the concept of AJAX.
	
## Definition
	First, let’s provide the *definition*. This will consist of a short, factual explanation in no more than 1-2 sentences. This establishes our baseline knowledge and will serve as our foundation moving forward.
In our example, the first step of our answer would simply be, “AJAX is Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.”

## Information
	Our next step is going to be to provide additional *information* in our answer. This information will further demonstrate our command of the subject and provide a jumping-off point for our comparison - which we’ll be covering next.
	To embellish our example answer, “AJAX communicates by transferring data between the client and server using XHR, which stands for XML HTTP Request.”

## Compare
	Now that we’ve proven we possess a thorough knowledge of this topic, let’s compare it to something else we know. This could be anything, even if it’s not tech-related.
	“AJAX is like exchanging a pair of shoes you ordered from Amazon. You drop off a package at the post office, they carry it to the warehouse, then carry the replacement pair back to you.”

## Examples
	Finally, let’s provide the interviewer with *examples*. These could consist of times you yourself have used the technology in question or even theoretical examples. Anything that further demonstrates your knowledge.
	To tie up our example answer, “I used AJAX recently to create a video player that contacted YouTube’s public API. In my video player, I only wanted results that were from reliable sources and consisted of quality content. I was able to use my own filtering algorithm to filter by channel subscribers, as well as like / dislike ratios.”

	With a simple framework, we have been able to provide an excellent answer to our interviewer. We have gone above the minimum, by only providing the technical definition, and we have prevented ourselves from over-talking and going down random rabbit holes by keeping our points clear, concise, and on-topic.
