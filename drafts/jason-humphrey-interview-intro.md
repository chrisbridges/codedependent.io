-------
August 29, 2019

Hosted by Thinkful

## Overview
Welcome to Developer Spotlight! Today we’ll be learning about the incredible journey of Jason Humphrey. Please feel free to follow along with this reference sheet and take advantage of the many additional resources that are linked within it.

## Jason Humphrey  
After graduating with a Computer Science degree from Marietta College in 2013, Jason accepted an invitation to Fidelity Investments’ post-grad program for technical talent. Over the course of the program, he quickly realized that he was not on the same level skill-wise as his peers. This came to a head when he failed a remedial programming course *twice*. 

Since then, Jason has committed himself to the science of learning and become an expert in effective learning and maximizing personal productivity. He has leveraged these skills to rise from fledgling post-grad to principal engineer and team lead for Fidelity. Jason has a passion for sharing the knowledge he’s learned and helping others achieve their peak potential.

Jason is the founder of [Coding Career Fast Lane](https://www.thecodingcareerfastlane.com) which helps developers achieve success throughout all stages of their career. You can also find him on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGiy8wPL_wmyiPQbYlhdrUw), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jasonhumphreyofficial/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-humphrey-87b26954/).
