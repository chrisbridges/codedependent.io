# A Credit Card System to Earn Max Points with Min Effort

## Why
_Proper_ use of credit cards is like getting 2-5% off of everything you buy. If you spend $50k / year, that can amount to $1k - $3k without you doing any extra work.

## Which point ecosystem to commit to?
Many "churners" (credit card users who are interested in maximizing sign-up bonuses) would balk at committing to any one system, but my credit card philosophy is to get the maximum benefit for the least amount of effort. When I first got into this game, it was very exciting and I would scour for how to make the best use of my spending. Now that I have the system on autopilot, I'm willing to forego an additional ~.15% more points on any given purchase for ease-of-use and lack of mental burden. The level at which you value your time should ultimately lead this decision, but for many this is a game to take the optimal path. I'd rather get 90% of the benefit for 5% of the effort.

## Biggest Caveat
If you have any history of carrying a credit card balance, this is absolutely not for you. I would go so far to say that if you even know what your credit card's APR is, avoid this. If you've struggled in the past, or are unsure, I would recommend getting something simple like the Chase Freedom Unlimited or Apple Card (or even a secured credit card if you want to be extra cautious), throw them on Autopay and use them for a year to determine if you have the financial discipline to make this system work for you. Some don't, and that's okay. Know thyself.

Credit card companies are willing to give away _free_ pennies for every dollar you spend hoping for one slip-up on your part that will make it worth their while. Playing the points game is like picking up loose change in front of a steamroller. With the proper setup though, you can be sure that that steamroller will never budge.**Always always always put your credit cards on AutoPay and pay the statement balance every month.** Firstly, because life is just easier that way. Secondly, you'll never need to worry about late fees or missing a payment. Treat this like a debit card. Even one month of interest payments can wipe out any potential awards you may earn.

## What's in my Wallet?

### Chase Sapphire Reserve (or Chase Sapphire Preferred)
When you're ready to really step your points game up, this (or the slightly cheaper Chase Sapphire Preferred) is the way to go. I strongly prefer the Reserve to the Preferred - [you can see a breakdown of the two cards and their various trade-offs here](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/chase-sapphire-preferred-vs-chase-sapphire-reserve/). This card makes all your Chase points earned with your other cards __50% more valuable__. So instead of 1.5% back on everything with the Freedom Unlimited, you're earning 2.25%. Freedom earns you up to 7.5%. Your 3% back on food & travel is now an easy 4.5%. This card is your wallet's Chris Paul, it makes everyone around it better.

### Chase Freedom Unlimited
If I could recommend but one card for the average person looking to dip their toe in the world of points, it would be this one. Simple unlimited 1.5% cash back on everything you buy. No categories, bonuses, or arbitrary dates to worry about. No hassle. Just points.

### Chase Freedom
Definitely my least-used card, depending on the quarterly bonus. If it's a quarterly bonus for something I wouldn't typically hit the cap for anyway, there's almost always someplace that you can buy $1500 worth of gift cards to maximize this perk. I've done this many times. Even buying some Vanilla Visa cards, Amex, etc and paying a few dollars in gift card fees, will net you ~$60 - ($1500 * .05 = $60 or $97.50 if you also have the Sapphire Reserve) in easy profit. Not bad for 10 minutes work. 

This is the only real form of "manufactured spending" I'll still occasionally do - essentially buying things like gift cards or arbitrary transfers that look like you're spending money while costing you little or nothing. This is most commonly used to either hit a sign-up bonus on a new card, which can often require thousands in spending in a relatively short amount of time, or to max out a bonus category like I'm doing here.

When possible, I try to always buy Amazon gift cards, but I've found these being carried increasingly less since I've started this game.

### Chase Ink Business Cash
This is technically a business card, but it's remarkably easy to obtain. Odds are you likely have some side income somehow that could technically qualify as a business. I was a tutor to support myself during my college years and put that under "Bridges Enterprises" - a sole-proprietorship. Thus, an empire was born.

The bonus categories for this card are understandably more business-centric, but still relatively worth it for the average person. 5x points are earned on internet and cell phone service. Since these services are likely to cost over $1000 / year on average, there's an easy $50 / year for paying those with this card.

This card has admittedly gotten less valuable to me over the years, since I used to pay my Verizon family plan bill with this each month, which really added up, but after Verizon released their own card, it only made sense to snag that one instead for the reasons I'll divulge below.

### Verizon Visa Card
When Verizon released their credit card, the killer perk was that you would save $10 off __each__ line that was on your plan. For my family plan made up of 5 individual lines, this was simply too good to pass up. $600 / year in real savings vastly outweighs a few dozen dollars in points. It's tempting when playing this game to see, '_5x points on your cell service_' and instinctively stick to it, but nothing beats more real cash in your pocket every month.

### Chase Amazon Card
Similar to the Verizon card, the value proposition on this card is simply too good to pass up. I buy basically everything I can on Amazon, and if you're a paying Amazon Prime customer already, this card is a no-brainer. Earn 5% points on all Amazon / Whole Foods purchases. Getting 5% back on something I was already going to buy? Easy. Another great choice if you're new to the credit card game and an Amazon Prime member.

### Honorable mention: Apple Card
It's no secret that I'm a huge Apple fan and so the Apple Card was a no-brainer. While it's cash back offerings aren't as strong as any of the other cards listed here, it's ease-of-use and baller Titanium physical card make this a great addition for anyone looking to step into the credit card game. The only real thing I use this for is to finance new Apple products at 0% interest - a tactic I always recommend if you already have the cash on hand anyway. This is not something I would recommend for anyone who hasn't thoroughly swum in the deep end of debt, but for those with the proper discipline, this can serve as a nice benefit.

The rewards on this card also leave a bit to be desired. Though you can receive 2% cash back at all places that accept Apple Pay, the Chase Freedom Unlimited earns 2.25% when combined with the Sapphire Reserve's 50% bonus.

### Conclusion
If you're brand new to the world of credit cards, I would recommend starting with a simple card like the Chase Freedom Unlimited or the Apple Card. Once you've established a solid history of on-time payments, start watching the points stack up with the Sapphire cards. 

No matter which cards you ultimately choose to use, throwing all eligible expenses on the cards combined with Autopay will net you the easiest money you'll earn all year.
