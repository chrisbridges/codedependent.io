# JS - Array That Returns Products of All Other Indexes
I recently subscribed to [Daily Coding Problem](dailycodingproblem.com) to help keep my coding challenge skills sharp. I’ve become increasingly involved in the interview process on my own team and I didn’t want to feel hypocritical asking candidates to solve problems and perform under pressure if I didn’t feel I could do the same. If you would like to follow along with my progress, and compare solutions, [feel free to check out my work in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/chrisbridges/code-wars-practice).

One of the first problems I was tasked with was, *Given an array of numbers, return a new array where each index is the product of all numbers in the array except for that index.* 

Essentially, if you have an array of `[1, 2, 3]`, the 0th index should be 6, because it’s the result of multiplying 2 and 3. First index would be 3, because 1 * 3. And so on.
