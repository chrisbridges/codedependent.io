# Primitive and Complex Data Types
In JavaScript, we have two different types of data: Primitives and Complex. 

Primitives are your more straight-forward data: booleans, numbers, strings, undefined, etc. These values are immutable, meaning they cannot be directly altered.

Complex data types essentially refer to Objects. What about Arrays you might ask? Arrays are also objects - thus, a complex data type.
