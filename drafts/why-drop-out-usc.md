# Why I Dropped Out of USC (for now)
Dropping out of college isn’t nearly as sexy as they make it out to be. In tech, it’s viewed as almost a rite of passage. An ongoing thread from the technology industry’s origins where computer programmers and telephone hackers were rebels. They used technology as a means of “sticking it to the man.” If the classic phrase, “Sex, drugs, and rock n roll” had siblings, “technology” would be its little brother. 

We’re all familiar with the successful dropouts: Gates, Zuckerberg, and the like. In addition to those who continuously rally against traditional education establishments like Peter Thiel. One could argue these individuals were not really who college is for. These people didn’t *need* university. They all had marketable in-demand skills already. A college degree would have merely served as a footnote on their path to success.

One of the numerous differences between those individuals and myself is that I did not share their skills upon my departure. I was a half-completed Chemistry major, turned Economics student. The “jack of all trades, master of none” would have been too-generous a compliment for my skills. My education up until that point had been predominantly theoretical. Sure, I could visualize the valence shell electrons of organic molecules in my head, and had been told continuously bombasted with the Efficient Market theory (A theory with every passing day Mr. Buffett, and the markets themselves, continuously disprove.), but these learnings don’t exactly jump off a resume.

My education was intended to serve as a stepping stone. A preliminary step that on its own served minimal value, but once I reached my final destination would finally have paid off. Quitting before reaching a worthy threshold would have resulted in squandered years and tens of thousands of dollars in wasted capital. So why did I still do it?

## The Irony of Being an Econ Student at a Private University
The irony of studying Economics at USC was that it became increasingly clear with each passing semester that I was squandering both my time and money. Economics is the study of resources and the opportunity costs associated with allocating them. By spending **$5000 per course** every semester, I had to continuously accept that this was the most efficient source of both financial and, most importantly, human (my time) capital. That was easy to accept until it wasn’t. 

Spending $20k - $25k on tuition alone, not to mention room, board, books, cost of living in Downtown Los Angeles, etc, I was spending upwards of $50k / year to obtain a degree that, as former graduates put it, “would teach me how to think”. Why wait until graduation to learn how to think? There’s no magic switch that’s flipped upon obtaining a Bachelor’s (or perhaps there is. I suppose I wouldn’t know.).

For four semesters of USC, this would cost me approximately $200k. When comparing a life-long investment like education to the alternatives, it makes sense to compare on long horizons. $200k compounded at 7% (we’ll assume market returns will average those of the past here) annually over 50 years is *$5,891,405*. If I invested my tuition at 20, and never saved another dime, I would retire a multi-millionaire. Let’s say you follow the narrative that market returns won’t equal what they’ve been in the past and assume a 4% annual return. That’s still $1,421,336. 

The numbers made continuing my current trajectory a difficult pill to swallow.

## Burnout
My college experience was not like many, especially those at USC. USC is an incredible institution, filled with some of the most brilliant and diverse minds from around the world. Following in kind, its price is also of the incredibly high variety. Accordingly, most students tend to be from wealthier families.

This couldn’t have been further from my individual reality. My sole parental contributions would have had to come from my single mother who worked as a personal trainer, while simultaneously going to school herself to pursue a career as a nurse. (You go, Mom.) Suffice to say, I was on my own. 

I worked nearly full-time, if not more, while I was in school. I did everything from online tutoring, food delivery, digital marketing, research studies - you name it. Anything to keep myself afloat. This wore on me heavily. It was difficult enough to earn passing grades, let alone the excellent marks I had grown accustomed to get to receiving to merit being at USC in the first place.

Since all of my time was filled with either classes, studying, and increasingly, work - my social life and enjoying “the college experience” were minimal. This is clearly an unsustainable situation for any individual and it was after 3 semesters of stress, and failing an Introduction to Statistics class (for context, I earned an A in Calculus 2 at Vanguard), I had to deeply look inward to ask why I was enduring all of this.

## Time Off
I submitted the paperwork to take a semester off. I had planned to take a semester off during my time at Vanguard due to similar life pressures I mentioned above. Then, when I was surprisingly accepted to USC, I figured this would be enough to keep me going for the remainder of my college career. Unfortunately, you can only outrun yourself for so long.

I had discussed with a few friends my situation and one mentioned that her dad was currently looking for an assistant for the next few months for a project he was working on. She suggested I reach out to him while I gave myself the time to further ponder my academic career. That project ended up being *Alice through the Looking Glass*, and the company, *The Walt Disney Studios*.

If you would like to read in-depth about my time at Disney, you can do so here.

My time there served me well and gave me a dose what I needed. I enjoyed earning a paycheck again - seeing money come in and my bank balance growing (albeit it modestly) instead of continuously coming up negative month after month. 

## To Return or Continue Working?
I decided after my time was up with Disney, that I would research companies I admired and continue this work trend, but only if the proper opportunity arose. If nothing surfaced, I would return to USC and finished what I started - this time with the slightest of financial cushions.

I stumbled upon an entry-level marketing position at Age of Learning, the creators of the popular early childhood education ABCmouse product. Having a younger brother by 12 years, I had seen my share of their TV commercials during constant reruns of Nick Jr, and accordingly was a little more familiar with the company’s offerings than most non-parents.

I figured this would serve as a perfect blend of my current skill set, passions, and future aspirations. I had some previous marketing experience from my odd jobs during school, and I idolized the technology industry. I could add value to this company while learning about the industry I wanted to partake in and furthering education for young children, something I care deeply about. It was a perfect match.

Thankfully, they thought so as well, as a week after initially applying I had an offer to join their marketing team (ironically booking the same TV commercials that had made me aware of the company in the first place). I was so elated I nearly forgot the ramifications of my acceptance. USC would now be on hold for the foreseeable future, along with the stresses and financial hardship it had brought me.

## Accepting Life Outside of School
It was easy to view this as an escape from the trials that higher education had brought me: no longer would I constantly stress about coming up with the rent, about whether or not to buy a decent meal versus gassing the car, or whether I could even afford to insure the thing. Upon further reflection, it brought a lot of uncertainty about my identity.

I had always been a natural student. A good one. When I was a child, I asked my mother what the highest degree attainable was and proudly proclaimed I would receive one someday. Giving up that part of my life affected me more deeply than I would have originally thought. Not only would school no longer be a part of my life, I would be a *dropout*, with all the connotations that come along with it. I didn’t finish that which I had prided myself on so deeply. USC was my proudest achievement upon acceptance. It was to be the catalyst for mine and my family’s future successes. 

I envisioned my children becoming legacy students. We would be football season ticket holders. We would scoff at the Bruins in Westwood and revitalize the finger fountain’s gesture (link) to anyone who thought they could compete with Southern Cal. I was to become a member of the elite Trojan network. “Trojans hire Trojans” we would always say. 22 years of my life. 17 years of education. That would all vanish, I thought, upon my leaving.

## There’s No Going Back, or is there?
The thing few people tell you when you drop out of college is you can always go back. I’ve remained in contact with my academic advisors and they’ve repeatedly assured me I can continue the same as I did when I choose to return. One such advisor even offered to help me immediately enroll for classes for the next semester upon my communication. The next semester started in two weeks. 

It’s been an important life lesson to learn that few decisions are as permanent as we think they are. There are almost always ways of getting back to where you started, especially if you take the proper precautions to limit the downside risk.

So yes, I am a college dropout - for now. It absolutely doesn’t mean that I’m anti-education or even anti-established education. The best investment I have made to date, was spending 2 years worth of Age of Learning savings to attend a coding bootcamp (you can read more about that here) and start my career in software. Though it has further entrenched my belief that investments in education, like all investments, should be viewed objectively and with a reasonable expected ROI. Is increased investment in a private education worth the marginal cost over a cheaper institution? That decision must be made by the individual, and those contributing to that education.

Would I send my children to USC? I honestly can’t say at this moment. That answer could vary drastically depending on my financial situation at the time. I believe I’m taking the proper steps to aid in that if they wanted to, but again we need to view this through a traditional investment lens of, ‘Is this worth the price?’ Warren Buffett famously says, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” Will the increased price have a proportional effect on value? Will the increased prestige of the professors and rubbing elbows with descendants of Schwab and Spielberg provide compounding returns they’ll enjoy throughout their lives? We’ll have to evaluate then. 

I believe I made the right decision for myself at the time. In a way, I believe quitting is a sign of strength (link). 

*A step backward, after making a wrong turn, is a step in the right direction.*
*-Kurt Vonnegut*

I wouldn’t change a thing about how my career has unfolded. Will it eventually include a chapter of my return to USC to complete what I started? It’s likely. When would that be? I can’t say.

To quote the founder of my former employer, 

*We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.*
*-Walt Disney*

I’ve enjoyed the path my curiosity has led me down. Perhaps one day that path will again intersect with McCarthy Quad.  Fight on ✌️
