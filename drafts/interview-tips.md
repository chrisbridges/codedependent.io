# Interview Tips
You love coding. The process of creating something from nothing and being able to express yourself through this medium exhilarates you, and you’ve decided to make this your career. You’ve researched companies you want to be a part of, and feel confident if you received an offer, you could contribute and be a valuable member of the team. You submit your resume, write a great cover letter, and you’ve been granted an interview! While exciting, the mere thought of an interview is enough to fill most with anxiety. Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s break down a few concepts to help relieve some of this discomfort, and empower you to feel more confident in your next interview.
	
~Routines~
	You more than likely have a daily routine that you stick to. This is good. Keep with it - especially before an interview. It can be easy to become so focused on our upcoming interview that we lose all perspective and begin neglecting our normal actions. The power of a daily routine is that it will help our mind believe that the days before an interview are just like any regular day. And guess what, they are! The achievements that result from your routines are what got you this interview in the first place. Don’t neglect them now. Whether it’s exercise, meditation, scheduled socialization with friends/family, keep with it.

~24 Hours Before Your Interview~
	The 24 hours leading up to your interview are crucial. Since your mind will likely be occupied with performing well, it can be helpful to relieve some of that cognitive load by laying out how you want the day of the interview to go. When are you going to wake up? What are you going to eat? Are you going to review any material? When are you going to arrive on location? Plan these details out in as explicit detail as possible, that way you won’t have to worry about them. This allows you to primarily focus on what’s important and remove the burdensome minutiae of that day.

~Research and Review~replace thorough with something else
Thorough research and review will be one of your greatest weapons in the interview process. By thoroughly researching the company, the team, and the role; you can eliminate the majority of uncertainty heading into your interview.

~Read the job description in depth.~
Not only what technologies and processes they use, but any soft skills you might be able to infer they’re looking for. Be sure that your answers to their questions can highlight traits they say they’re looking for. A lot of helpful information can be gleaned from a description with a thorough reading.

~Know your own resume~
This might seem silly at first. Of course, you know your own resume. Why wouldn’t you? You wrote it. They key here is to ensure that your resume is up to date, as well as understanding that anything you have on there is fair game to be asked about in the interview.
Do you *really*have a proficient understanding of 8 languages/frameworks? While this can make your resume seem impressive, if you can’t answer common interview questions about these technologies, it’s best not to add them. Proclaiming expertise on a subject and then backpedaling is an immediate red flag. Now the interviewer isn’t sure if everything else on your resume is trustworthy. Understand your resume and how it will be perceived. This will save you from surprises.

~Know Who You’ll Be Speaking With~
Ask who you’ll be speaking with the day of the interview and research them. A high-level of understanding of that person’s career and history can lead to valuable insights. Perhaps you have similar educational backgrounds or interests. Maybe you both worked for the same company at different times. What you choose to do with this information can vary, but having additional ammunition is always a plus in the interview process.

~Practice~
	One of the things we cannot emphasize enough is practice. Interviewing can seem especially unpleasant because it’s not something most of us have to go through often. Thankfully, interviewing is a skill, and like any other skill, can be improved upon with time and effort. While it may seem daunting, We promise every interview experience, no matter how unpleasant, will strengthen your skills and benefit you in the future.
	
	~Mock Interviews~
	Mock interviews can be an especially helpful practice. What better way to simulate the pressure and environment of a real interview? While this may seem uncomfortable at first, you’ll grow increasingly relaxed and learn how to calmly and effectively answer questions.

	~Types of Questions~
There are 4 broad types of questions you should be familiar with in interviews. While these could merit an entire post on their own, we’ll briefly address them here.

	~Behavioral~
These questions are designed to see how you respond to certain scenarios. These are often asked to determine your cultural fit within the organization and is a chance to demonstrate your soft skills.
	
	~Technical~
Every engineer should be expected to perform technically in an interview. These can vary from high-level architecture questions to detailed live coding exercises. Which you encounter will depend upon the role you’re applying for. A full understanding of the job description and your company research will serve you well in this area.

	~Open-ended~
	Open-ended questions are asked to see how you deal with ambiguity and lack of direction. The interviewer will often provide you with a prompt and let you run with it. This is a chance to show how you think about problems, break them down, and ultimately arrive at a solution.

	~Insight~
*Not really remembering what these are. How are they different from behavioral? Am I mixing these up?*
*Validate that you’ve done something - Tyler Wall: his experience with architecture - didn’t have knowledge he claimed. Insight into an experience. Can they do what they say they can do?*
*As a principal: When you start leading: you lose your own time. Insight into things like that. Things you would only know if you had actually done the things you’re claiming to have done.*

~Prep Tips~
	We want to conclude this post with some general preparation tips.

	~Be honest~
First and foremost, be honest. Lying in an interview never ends well. You will be found out. It’s best to even avoid exaggeration. If you don’t understand a question or have no idea of the answer, be forthright about it; that is always an acceptable response. Giving a nonsense answer, or trying to deceive the interviewer into believing you know what you’re talking about will not fly. If they’re asking the question, the overwhelming odds are that they themselves know the answer.

	~Be personable~
	This can appear difficult for those who label themselves as shy or introverted. Being personable does not mean you need to be incredibly extroverted or outgoing. Engage with your interviewers. They’re people too. Active listening, asking insightful questions, and simply showing an interest in what they have to say will go a long way.

	~Confidence~
You don’t need to know the answer to every question in order to have confidence in what you say. Questions that you do know, answer them confidently. Questions that you do not know, express this honestly and follow that up with steps you might take to find that answer. It might even be wise to ask the interviewer themselves for the answer afterward. This will show that you are confident in what you do know and that you have an interest in continuing to learn and grow.

	~Handling the Unknown~
Grow a familiarity in dealing with the unknown. No matter how much preparation or interview practice you subject yourself to, there will always be something unexpected that happens in your interview - something you didn’t prepare for. This is okay. Feel confident in the preparation that you have done, and when something unexpected arises, take a moment, and explain your thoughts to the interviewer. The interviewer will never expect you to have a holistic knowledge about everything they ask.
