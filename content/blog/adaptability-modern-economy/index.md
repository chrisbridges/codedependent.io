This was an off-the-cuff essay I wrote given the below prompt. I’d like to explore this topic further, but I was proud of what I came up with over the course of an hour.

**Prompt**: *Many people have argued that the skills needed to be successful in today’s workforce have changed. What skills do you feel an individual needs to be successful in a job today? Why do you feel these skills are most important? In an essay to be read by a teacher, identify the skills you feel are most needed by an individual to be successful at work and provide reasons to persuade your teacher that these are the most critical skills for success.*

The workforce as we know it has forever changed. Advancements in technology have shifted the international business model in ways previously unseen. Globalization has flattened our world, creating vast access to labor and resources previously untapped. This shift has left many to wonder how they can succeed in this new economy. What skills can one acquire to ensure they fall on the correct side of the demand curve? 

Understandably, the answers most often given reside in technology, healthcare, data-driven roles, etc.  Fields that will help push this technological metamorphosis even further. 

I would argue the answer is none of the above. While these industries will surely continue to push incredible progress, and with it wealth and security for those involved, those who will find success in these fields - or any field - will be those who continuously learn and adapt. The common thread between all who achieve career and financial success in this new workforce will be a willingness to thoroughly and honestly evaluate one’s skillset, and with that; the commitment to invest in oneself and improve throughout the duration of their career. 

Those who cling to antiquated processes will inevitably find themselves frustrated at this change. With advancements in automation, many have feared disruption in their current roles. While I understand the fear and hesitance that accompanies this, I argue it should be welcomed as a positive. Your brain is the most advanced computer the world has ever seen - with creative capacities unmatched by even the most advanced machines. If a thoughtless computer is capable of doing our work, it was a waste of our incredible potential. We are now unshackled to pursue meaningful work. To create. To discover. To pioneer.

The most valuable skill in the new economy will not be a skill at all, but a desire. A desire to continuously grow and learn. A willingness to accept that our world is forever evolving, and our skills should follow in kind. I believe Eric Hoffer summarized this point best. 

*“In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.”* 

The economy of the past exists now only in history. Those who are willing and able to drive change will find themselves beautifully equipped to succeed no matter the circumstance.
